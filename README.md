# Bachelorarbeit-Automatische Erkennung und Korrektur der Bildausrichtung mithilfe von Convolutional Neural Networks

Automatic detection and correction of image orientation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) <br>

The following description explains how to train the CNN EfficientnetV2, evaluate it and also how to use the implemented app.
There are more scripts that were created in order to e.g. convert .csv files to .txt files and download test files, but those are not necessary for testing the code.
The usage of them will be explained below. <br>
Note: Some of the Code used for training the CNN architectures is taken partially from Daniel Saez GitHub repository https://github.com/d4nst/RotNet and was only slightly modified for my own purposes.
### Load required modules
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## The following commands can also be used to train ResNetV2 and DenseNet201
### Train EfficientnetV2 with Google street view images
The training script will automatically download all needed images and puts them into the correct folders, so there is no need to download anything in advance.
* `cd Train_street` <br>
* python ./code/train_EfficientnetV2_street_view.py
  
### Train EfficientnetV2 with Open Images
For training the model with Open Images, one first needs to download the training and validation data separately before running the training script.
* `cd Train_OI`
#### Download test and train images using 50 processes â†’ lower/larger number may be used depending on your hardware
* `python ./code/downloader.py ./code/train.txt --download_folder=./data/train --num_processes=50`
* `python ./code/downloader.py ./code/validate.txt --download_folder=./data/validate --num_processes=50`
#### Start the training
For the training, we're going to use the model that has already been trained with the Google street view data. The pretrained model can also be downloaded using this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_pfYORJG_jsozsPf9a-v0l74quHa6hN/view?usp=sharing. 
* Copy efficientnetv2_street_view.hdf5 to ./models
* `python ./code/train_efficientnetV2_open_images.py`
## Download with Google street view + Open Images already completely pretrained models
### Download pretrained EfficientnetV2
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlRecLAzn3R9CUO3k2ArP_ERkihXuaOj/view?usp=sharing <br>
### Download pretrained DenseNet201
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VlI_1dShRIOY77EiWAVKMxX8QbrsBzM/view?usp=sharing
### Download pretrained ResNet50V2
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AY6WEFamnlGBoQBAwFwpjpdyxbtGSeh-/view?usp=sharing
## Evaluate EfficientnetV2
In order to test how well EfficientnetV2 performs, I added an evaluation script. This script rotates the test images by a random angle and lets the model predict that angle.
It then writes the mean and median error into a text file and also creates a histogram of all error angles for visual interpretation.
* copy efficientnetv2_sv_open_images.hdf5 to ./models
* Replace '/path/to/test/images' to actual path, test_num to the number of test images and 'EfficientnetV2_sv_oi' to the name you want the produced text file to be named
your output files names to start with: `python .\code\test_model.py -m './models/efficientnetv2_sv_open_images.hdf5' -t '/path/to/test/images' -n test_num -o 'EfficientnetV2_sv_oi'`

## Use the Image Editor app
* copy efficientnetv2_sv_open_images.hdf5 to ./ImageEditor/model
* `cd ./ImageEditor`
* `python ImageEditor.py`

## Download and use the Image Editor app as a .exe
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QwOQh38SKznwh9v2xghUYGyjUeNok952/view?usp=sharing <br>
After the download is done, one just needs to execute the installer, and after it's done, the app can be run.
If the download doesn't work, then here is the .exe in a zipped format:
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/13YZfGALaMkbqzVVSfxGHnz_PPOX-dmTD/view?usp=sharing
## Further scripts
#### csv_to_txt.py
* Given the file 'train-images-boxable-with-rotation.csv', it extracts the ImageID and Subset and writes those in a .txt file so the downloader.py script
can use it to download the images by ID. The paths are hardcoded.
#### visual_evaluation.py
* This script has been used to create visual evaluations of a model using testdata. In order to use it for the own purposes, one needs to modify the paths used in the script. It then produces images with three columns containing that original, the rotated and the corrected images.
#### download_unsplashed.py
* The script downloads 1000 random Unsplash images from the .tsv file using 32 parallel processes. It then writes them into ./data/unsplashed_images/ <br>
The images can be used for testing purposes and the number of parallel processes can be adjusted by editing the variable `max_workers`
#### detect_oblique_images.py
* This script detects all images in the folder './data/train', that are oblique and writes their IDs into a text file.
#### remove_rotated_images.py
* This script prompts the user to enter the path to a text file containing image IDs and removes all of those images.
